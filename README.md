You are a lighting board operator for a kindergarten class play.  Shine the stage lights in the right colors and at the right spots to light up the actors in the sequence. You have many questions, but none of them are answered. Why are these kids performing in such a nice theatre? Why do they get to demand what lights they receive? And why on earth is that one kid dressed like a lightbulb?! You don't know, and it doesn't matter. There are parents out there who will kill if their kid isn't seen perfectly lit up on stage. So get on out there and help those kids find their light!
